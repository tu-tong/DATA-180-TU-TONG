20/20. Good job.

Make sure that you have accepted the hw invitation link, and working with your clone repository.

**Due date:** October 12 beginning of class.

**Reminder:** You can insert R code in your Rmd file as a chunk in the following way:
```{r}
# Your code goes here
```
Make sure to insert a chunk for each (sub)section of the assignment.

**Theme of the assignment**: This time we will practice visualization using ggplot2, and create cool maps. Load in the `Cars93` dataset by running the following code chunk:

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # keep in mind you have to install ggplot2 first via install.packages() if it's not installed in your machine
library(MASS)
data(Cars93)
head(Cars93)
```

# Ggplot2

## Task 1
Create a simple scatterplot using ggplot2 where x axis shows `EngineSize`, y axis shows `MPG.city`.

* Use blue color for your dots.
* Use size = 2 for the dot sizes.
* Use xlim and ylim to make sure your x and y axis ranges make sense.
* Add a title, subtitle, x axis label, y axis label, and a caption using title, subtitle, caption options inside `+ labs()`.

 
```{r}
#find x, y limits 
min(Cars93$EngineSize)
max(Cars93$EngineSize)
min(Cars93$MPG.city)
max(Cars93$MPG.city)

max(Cars93$MPG.city)
ggplot(Cars93, aes(EngineSize, MPG.city)) +
  geom_point(col ="blue", size = 2) +
  xlim(1,5.7) +
  ylim(15, 46) +
  labs(x="Engine size", y = "City MPG", title = "City MPG vs Engine size", subtitle = "miles per gallon vs litres", caption = "based on the Cars93 dataset")
  

```

## Task 2
Recreate the scatterplot in Task 1. Add the following functionality:

* Use a different color for each car `Type`.
```{r}
ggplot(Cars93, aes(EngineSize, MPG.city, color = Type)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  xlim(1, 5.7) +
  ylim(15, 46) +
  labs(x = "Engine size", y = "City MPG", title = "City MPG vs Engine size for all types of car", subtitle = "Miles per gallon vs litres", caption = "based on Cars93 dataset")
```

## Task 3
Recreate the scatterplot in Task 2. Add the following functionality:

* Fit and overlay a smooth curve.
* Make the curve line red, and dashed. (Hint linetype is the option you can use to set line style as 'dashed')

```{r}
ggplot(Cars93, aes(EngineSize, MPG.city, color = Type)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  xlim(1, 5.7) +
  ylim(15, 46) +
  labs(x = "Engine size", y = "City MPG", title = "City MPG vs Engine size for all types of car", subtitle = "Miles per gallon vs litres", caption = "based on Cars93 dataset") +
  geom_smooth(color = "red", linetype = "dashed")
```

## Task 4
Create a barplot showing count of cars by `AirBags` using ggplot2.

* `geom_bar()` is the function that creates a barplot.
* Use a different color for each bar.
* Add a title, subtitle, x axis label, y axis label, and a caption using title, subtitle, caption options inside `+ labs()`.

```{r}
ggplot(Cars93, aes(AirBags)) +
  geom_bar(fill = c("darkviolet", "chocolate1", "darkolivegreen4")) +
  labs(title= "Number of airbags", subtitle = "airbags standard", x = "Availability", y = "Count", caption = "based on Cars93 dataset")
```

## Task 5
Recreate the barplot in Task 4 for different car `Origin`, such that you create one barplot for each `Origin` category and display all on the same graph.

* You can have `Origin` as the "x" variable by setting `x=Origin.`
* Use `fill=AirBags` to get a different color (and bar) by `AirBags`.
* in `geom_bar(), use `position='dodge'` to have the barplots side by side.

```{r}
ggplot(Cars93, aes(x = Origin, fill = AirBags)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title= "Number of car of different origins", subtitle = "non-USA or USA", x = "Origin", y = "Count", caption = "based on Cars93 dataset")
```

# Maps
Load Australia's state map data via running:
```{r}
# install the packages below by uncommenting the lines. You need to do this only once.
#install.packages("ozmaps") # downloads the map needed
#install.packages("sf") # package used to analyze spatial data
library(ozmaps)
library(sf)
au_states <- ozmaps::ozmap_states # read in spatial dataframe object

# Display the data
head(au_states)
```
Notice that `NAME` includes the name of a state, `geometry` includes spatial coordinate data for each state polygon (area).

## Task 1
Create a map of Australia using `ggplot2`.
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=au_states) 
```

## Task 2
Modify your map such that each state is displayed with a different color. (Hint: use the fill option as an aes setting with variable `NAME`.)
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=au_states, aes(fill = NAME)) 
```
## Task 3
Read in the capital city dataframe showing each capital and its latitude and longitude information by running:
```{r}
au_capitals <- tibble::tribble( 
  ~city,           ~lat,     ~lon,
  "Sydney",    -33.8688, 151.2093,  
  "Melbourne", -37.8136, 144.9631, 
  "Brisbane",  -27.4698, 153.0251, 
  "Adelaide",  -34.9285, 138.6007, 
  "Perth",     -31.9505, 115.8605, 
  "Hobart",    -42.8821, 147.3272, 
  "Canberra",  -35.2809, 149.1300, 
  "Darwin",    -12.4634, 130.8456, 
)
```

Display the capitals as points on your map from Task 1. (Hint: combine `geom_sf()` with `+ geom_point()`)

* Use `col = "red"` such that points are displayed in red color.
* Use `size=2` to make points larger.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = au_states) +
  geom_point(data = au_capitals, aes(lon, lat), col = "red", size = 2) 
```


## Task 4
Let's take a look at a different projection output. Change your map's projection to epsg 3112 by adding `+ coord_sf()`. Recall the option that goes inside `coord_sf()` is `st_crs(4_digit_code)`
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = au_states) +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(3112))
```

## Task 5
Lastly, let's display the same map using `mapview()`. Load the `mapview` package.

```{r}
#install.packages('mapview') # interactive display
library(mapview)
```
Create an interactive map of Australia using `mapview()`

```{r}
mapview(au_states)
```

## Task 6
Let's display the capitals on the map like before. First convert the `au_capitals` dataframe to spatial dataframe object by running:
```{r}
capitals_geo <- st_as_sf(au_capitals, coords = c("lon", "lat"))
```

Now add the new spatial capitals object via + (that is, you can use the following syntax to add a layer: `mapview() + mapview()`)

* You can use the option `col.regions='red'` to make capitals appear in color red, and `legend=F` in second `mapview()` to remove the uninformative second set of legend. 

```{r}
mapview(au_states) + 
  mapview(capitals_geo, col.region = 'red', legend = FALSE )
```



You are done! 🏁 Don't forget to commit and push your .Rmd file to your Github repository before the due date.
