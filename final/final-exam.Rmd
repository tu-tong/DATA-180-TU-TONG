## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#read csv file and libraries
dataset <- "/Users/tu/Desktop/DATA180-Tu/final/loan_default_data_set.csv"
loan_df <- read.csv(dataset) 
loan_df
library(tidyverse)
```

## 1.Data Wrangling

a) The dimension: 20000x21
- The data set has 20000 rows and 21 columns

b) Column names are:"tot_balance", "avg_bal_cards", "credit_age", "credit_age_good_account" , "credit_card_age", "num_acc_30d_past_due_12_months", "num_acc_30d_past_due_6_months", "num_mortgage_currently_past_due", "tot_amount_currently_past_due", "num_inq_12_month", "num_card_inq_24_month", "num_card_12_month",   "num_auto_.36_month", "uti_open_card", "pct_over_50_uti", "uti_max_credit_line", "pct_card_over_50_uti", "ind_XYZ", "rep_income", "rep_education", "Def_ind"

c) Types of data in the data set: numeric, integer, and character.

```{r}
dim(loan_df)
columns <- colnames(loan_df)
lapply(loan_df, class)
```

d) Column that have missing values: rep_income
rep_income is missing 7.795% values.
```{r}
numNa <- colSums(is.na(loan_df))

nVal_rep_income <- nrow(loan_df)
nVal_rep_income
(1559/20000)*100
```

e) We should deal with missing values by 

f) With this data, I would fit a supervised/unsupervised learning model. Whhy?

g) Drop all rows with missing values, print dim()
```{r}
new_loan_df <- drop_na(loan_df)
new_loan_df
dim(new_loan_df)
```

## 2. Data summary statistics

```{r}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
